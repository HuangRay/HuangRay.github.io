                    <p>
                        I am from Taiwan, a student at Tamkang University (TKU) of the master of the second year, and now, I am living in Tokyo,
                        Japan, for one year of exchanging in the Eletro-Communication University (UEC). I came here to learn
                        Japanese and do the research, and enjoy the Japan's life as well. The reason I came here is not only
                        I like Japan but also that I know Japan is goot at robotics, thus, I want to learn from here.
                        <br>
                        <br> I am researching about robotics. In Taiwan, My research is about mobile robot, and now in Japan
                        is researching about snake-like robot. The mobile is a soccer robot which the purpose of the robot
                        is to make it more intelligent so that the robot could automatically find the target and choose a
                        strategy to attack the opposite goal. I am in charge of the strategy and the controller of the robot.
                        Our team join to the Federation of International Robot Soccer Association (FIRA) which is a competition
                        of the robot to make our robot more competitive. In Japan, I am going to research about snake-like
                        robot, and it a new field for me. I know it would be difficult but I still want to try it.
                        <br>
                        <br> Except the research and studying, sometimes I went around the Tokyo in the weekend by train. My
                        purpose of exchanging is not only for researching all the day though it is still an important part
                        but I wnat to know Japan and improve Japanese as well.

                        As I talk before, I research about the robots, including mobile robot and snake-like robot, and I will briefly introduce
                        both robots.

                    <p>
                        As the name of mobile robot, it must should be able to move. In TKU, I research the robots which the purpose is to play the
                        soccer games are with the three wheels, and it is not controlled by human, in others words, the robot
                        shoud move automatically which is based on the environment or the situations, so the robots should
                        judge the environment or the situations and then make the corresponding behaviors. The most special
                        place of the robot is that A robot has three wheels, called omnidirectional wheel, and a omnidirectional
                        vision system. Because the robot is for the soccer games, the omnidirectional wheels could make the
                        robot moves fast and turns smoothly and the omnidirectional vision system could make the robot watches
                        360 degrees around the robot, namely, the robot can know all of the situations around itself. There
                        is a short video below which the robot is designed by TKU team.

                        <em>Snake-like robot</em>

                    <p>
                        As the name of snake-like robot, it must like a snake. In UEC, I am now joining in the lab which researchs about the snake-like
                        robot. This is still a new field for me, and just started researching. There are some advantages
                        in the robot, likes that have higher adaptability within the envirtonment than a normal mobile robot
                        and could cross the complex terrains. Though the snake-like robot is much more difficult, I will
                        try to do it. However, I wish I would have a good result half year later.
